      <h2 class="section-heading">Project Goal</h2>
      <p>The goal of this capstone project was to perform customer segmentation and create an effective marketing campaign for an online retail company.</p>

      <h2 class="section-heading">Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>It is a critical requirement for a business to understand the value derived from a customer. RFM is a method used for analyzing customer value. Customer segmentation is the practice of segregating the customer base into groups of individuals based on some common characteristics such as age, gender, interests, and spending habits. The objective is to perform customer segmentation using RFM analysis. The resulting segments can be ordered from most valuable (highest recency, frequency, and value) to least valuable (lowest recency, frequency, and value).</p>

      <h2 class="section-heading">Tasks Performed</h2>
      <ul class="task-list">
        <li>Data Cleaning:
          <ul>
            <li>Removed duplicates from the transactional data.</li>
            <li>Handled missing values by employing appropriate techniques.</li>
            <li>Standardized data formats for consistency.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Data Transformation:
          <ul>
            <li>Aggregated transactional data at the customer level.</li>
            <li>Calculated key metrics such as recency, frequency, and monetary value.</li>
            <li>Transformed the data into a suitable format for RFM analysis.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Data Modeling - RFM:
          <ul>
            <li>Assigned RFM scores to each customer based on recency, frequency, and monetary value.</li>
            <li>Segmented customers into groups based on their RFM scores.</li>
            <li>Identified valuable customer segments (e.g., high-value customers) and less valuable segments.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Data Modeling - K-means clustering algorithm:
          <ul>
            <li>Applied the K-means clustering algorithm to further segment customers.</li>
            <li>Grouped customers based on similarities in their RFM scores or other selected features.</li>
            <li>Enhanced segmentation precision and provided additional insights into customer behavior.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Data Reporting - Dashboarding in Tableau:
          <ul>
            <li>Utilized Tableau to create a dashboard for data reporting.</li>
            <li>Included visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, and customer segmentation plots.</li>
            <li>Effectively communicated the results of the analysis and actionable insights to stakeholders.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The project aimed to analyze transactional data for an online retail company and create customer segmentation to support targeted marketing campaigns. The combination of RFM analysis and the K-means clustering algorithm allowed for a comprehensive understanding of customer value and behavior. The Tableau dashboard provided an intuitive and visually appealing way to present the results, enabling informed decision-making based on the analysis.</p>
